# Panel data econometrics with R: the plm package

library(plm)

# inspect dimensionality
pdim(dat, index = c("iso", "year"))

# panel data estimators
plm() # plm can do (amongst others):
  # pooling:           --> model = "pooling" (same as lm())
  # fixed effects:     --> model = "within"
  # random effects:    --> model = "random"
  # first differences: --> model = "fd"

# various tests
mtest() # Arellano-Bond test of serial correlation for GMM models based on the residuals
pbgtest() # Breusch-Godfrey test of serial correlation for (the idiosyncratic component of) errors in panel models (pooling, within, or random) based on the residuals
pdwtest () # Durbin-Watson test of serial correlation for (the idiosyncratic component of) errors in panel models (pooling, within, or random) based on the residuals; don't use in models with autoregressive effects!
phtest() # (Durbin-Wu-)Hausman test based on the difference of the vectors of coefficients of (usually) a FE and RE model
purtest() # Unit root tests

# extract fixed effects
fixef()

# make data balanced

# merge model fixed effects with raw means: don't confuse fixed effects with "normal levels" or something - they simply account for unobserved constant effects, i.e. the portion of y in i that is not explained by the other, time-varying covariates and that is unit-constant across time

# What about time-fixed effects?

  # would pick up variation in the outcome that occurs over time and is not attributed to other explanatory variables
  # --> capture the influence of aggregate (time-series) trends
  # --> could help you deal with heteroskedasticity across time, i.e. variance of the errors increasing or decreasing with time

# fixed-effects estimator with plm

# effect = 
  # individual --> cross-sectional fixed effects
  # time --> time fixed effects
  # twoways --> time and cross-sectional fixed effects a.k.a. twoway fixed effects

# Using Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) --


# Beck and Katz 1995: 
  # TSCS data, such as country panels, often tackled with models that do not account properly for complex error structures 
  # common problem: panel heteroskedasticity, where each country has its own error variance
  # contemporaneous correlation of errors: due to common shocks, error for one country might be correlated with errors for other countries in same year
  # autocorrelation: errors for a given country are correlated with previous errors for that country

# it's a mess!
# this has an impact on your standard errors --> observations are more similar than they should be
# PCSE estimator suggested as one remedy for this problem - it's pretty popular in political science
# there are others on the market, such as Driscoll and Kraay (1998)â€™s spatial correlation consistent (SCC) estimator


# extract complete cases
dat_sub <- dplyr::select(dat, socexp_t_pmp, gov_left2, instcons, unemp, iso, year)
dat_sub <- dat_sub[complete.cases(dat_sub),]

# run OLS
summary(model_pooled <- lm(socexp_t_pmp ~ gov_left2 + instcons + unemp, data = dat_sub))

# panel-corrected standard errors
model_pcse <- pcse(model_pooled, groupN = dat_sub$iso, groupT = dat_sub$year)
summary(model_pcse)

# pcse() cannot be applied on plm objects - there is another solution:
summary(model_pooled <- plm(socexp_t_pmp ~ gov_left2 + instcons + unemp, data = dat_sub, index = c("iso", "year"), model = "pooling"))
plm2 <- coeftest(model_pooled, vcov=function(x) vcovBK(x, type = "HC1", cluster = "time"))
